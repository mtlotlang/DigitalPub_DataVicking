# About the Unicorn Projectt** 
"Unicorn" is a term used in the venture capital industry to describe a privately held startup worth more than $1 billion. The term was first popularized by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures, a venture capital fund based in Palo Alto, California.

Unicorns can also refer to a recruitment phenomenon in the human resources (HR) industry. HR managers can have high expectations for filling a role, leading them to look for candidates with higher qualifications than what is required for a specific role. In essence, these managers are looking for a unicorn, which leads to a disconnect between their ideal candidate and who they can hire from the pool of available people.
